ðŸš€ Dataset Update: Announcing KnowAir-V2! ðŸš€

We are excited to announce a major upgrade to the original KnowAir (PM2.5-GNN) dataset with the official release of KnowAir-V2! This is a brand-new, higher-quality benchmark dataset for air quality forecasting.

Key improvements in KnowAir-V2 include:
- Longer Temporal Span: Data covers from 2016 to 2023.
- Richer Variables: Includes not only PM2.5 but also O3 and more related meteorological variables.
- Higher Data Quality: The data has undergone rigorous preprocessing and imputation, reaching an operational-level standard.

For all new research and projects, we strongly recommend using KnowAir-V2. This dataset is designed to provide a powerful benchmarking platform for more advanced spatio-temporal prediction models that integrate physical-chemical knowledge, such as PCDCNet.

## Experiment Setup

open `config.yaml`, do the following setups.

- set data path after your server name. Like mine.

```python
filepath:
  GPU-Server:
    knowair_fp: /data/wangshuo/haze/pm25gnn/KnowAir.npy
    results_dir: /data/wangshuo/haze/pm25gnn/results

```

- Uncomment the model you want to run.

```python
#  model: MLP
#  model: LSTM
#  model: GRU
#  model: GC_LSTM
#  model: nodesFC_GRU
   model: PM25_GNN
#  model: PM25_GNN_nosub
```

- Choose the sub-datast number in [1,2,3].

```python
 dataset_num: 3
```

- Set weather variables you wish to use. Following is the default setting in the paper. You can uncomment specific variables. Variables in dataset **KnowAir** is defined in `metero_var`.

```python
  metero_use: ['2m_temperature',
               'boundary_layer_height',
               'k_index',
               'relative_humidity+950',
               'surface_pressure',
               'total_precipitation',
               'u_component_of_wind+950',
               'v_component_of_wind+950',]

```

## Run

```bash
python train.py
```

abstract = {When predicting PM2.5 concentrations, it is necessary to consider complex information sources since the concentrations are influenced by various factors within a long period. In this paper, we identify a set of critical domain knowledge for PM2.5 forecasting and develop a novel graph based model, PM2.5-GNN, being capable of capturing long-term dependencies. On a real-world dataset, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and examine its abilities of capturing both fine-grained and long-term influences in PM2.5 process. The proposed PM2.5-GNN has also been deployed online to provide free forecasting service.},
